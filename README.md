# Movie Store

This program implements a movie store which processes transactions from an input file. This program also implements an inventory and the movies it contains, as well as a hashtable and the customers it stores. These customers can rent and return movies, and their transaction history is stored. Movies can have several types, with the program using an inheritence hierarchy stemming from an abstract movie class to implement said types. It also uses factories to create movies and transaction types.
